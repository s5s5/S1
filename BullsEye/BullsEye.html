<h1>★ Firefighting(S1) ★</h1>

<p>Firefighting for children playing with 2 to 5 years of age, it's very simple, can let your child know the
  firefighters and their work, while the fire truck knows how to work.</p>

<p>I also hope that my baby like, this game is also for you.</p>

<p>Firefighting is my first APP, it has a lot of problems, I hope you can tell me, thank you.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><em>Enjoy!</em></p>
